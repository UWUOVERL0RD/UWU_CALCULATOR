    # SO HERE IS ~O~U~R~ MY!!! PLAN
    # 0. (THIS IS 0 BECAUSE IT WAS ADDED LATER) CHECK IF IT'S "EXIT"
    #  0.1 IF YEAH THE BYE BAI
    # 1. TRY
    #  1.1 EAVL
    #      UH NO
    #      EVAL
    #      ^
    #      | THAT IS THE CORRECT SPELLING, "EVAL". NOT "EAVL"
    #  1.2. PRINT THE VALUE
    # 2. CATCH
    #  2.1. CALL USER A BAKA
    # 3. PROIT!!!!!!!

    # SO LET'S DO IT

    if THE_EXPRESSION.strip().lower() == "exit":
        print("BAI BAH")
        sys.exit()

    try:
        VALUE = eval(THE_EXPRESSION)
        print(VALUE)
    except:
        # YEAH SORRY IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED TRY EXCEPT
        #                         AND NOT TRY CATCH
        #                                                 I AM NOT SORRY
        print("USER WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING")
        print(f"I DID NOT TELL YOU TO EVER TYPE \"\"{THE_EXPRESSION}\"\"")
        print("IF YOU WANTED TO EXIT JUST TYPE EXIT")
        print()
        print()
    print()
